# 👋 Hi there, I'm Okpe Francis Roberts

### 🧑‍💻 Aspiring Software Engineer | Python & Web Development | Future SaaS & FinTech Builder

I'm currently on a mission to become a world-class software engineer from Nigeria 🇳🇬. I started my journey as a non-technical person, but every day, I'm learning, building, and growing. I believe in **learning by doing** — one project, one line of code at a time.

---

### 🚀 What I'm Learning
- ✅ Python Programming (Basics to Projects)
- ✅ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Frontend)
- ✅ Git & GitHub (Version Control & Collaboration)
- ✅ Software Engineering Fundamentals (Roadmap in Progress)
- ✅ Databases (SQL, PostgreSQL)

---

### 🛠️ Current Projects
Here are some of the beginner-friendly projects I'm building and improving:

- 🔐 [ATM Simulator](https://github.com/OkpeFrancisRoberts/atm-simulator) – Python app with balance, deposit, withdraw, and password.
- 📁 More projects coming as I progress in my journey...

---

### 🎯 2025 Goals
- Launch my first **SaaS or FinTech** product built with Python and JavaScript
- Master fullstack development (React + Django)
- Create a strong GitHub portfolio with real-world apps
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Build an audience by sharing my journey
